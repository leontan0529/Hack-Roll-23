# Hack-Roll-23

# Created by Kelly Foo, Leon Tan, Ong Wei Xiang, Yeo Zong Yao
# Name: ePortfolio Generator
# Purpose: Simplify the process for students who have their resume ready and wants to create an ePortfolio in shortest period of time.
# How:
  - Converter: Using Python, convert resume (in .docx, and other formats) into an ePortfolio by searching for titles and sub-pointers.
  - Insert titles and sub-pointers into templates given.
  - Users will have the flexibility to edit template, texts and even input more content (text, images etc) to provide more clarifications and their existing projects.
  
 # Current Progress:
  - Able to convert .docx to .txt in order to search for titles, forming key-value pair for titles-pointers.
  - 1 set of template for ePortfolio using .html and .css
  - Have not tested insertion of key-pair values into template.
